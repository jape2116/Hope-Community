	* We will be down with the curriculum we are using now Dec 31! We will start this curriculum that first Sunday in January. I will have the first 2 months curriculum next week to start looking through. The good thing about us starting a few months behind them is they have already started working out kinks. Also, each month (4-5 lessons) work through the Lord’s Prayer! So it’s using 3DM stuff without the specific language. Also, the point is to help our kiddos become bible literate. I will bring the curriculum to church on the 17th if you guys wanted to look through it at the board meeting!
